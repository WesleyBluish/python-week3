# Week 3 Python Assignment

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates how to create a function in Python that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. If the discount percentage is 20% or higher, the discount is applied; otherwise, the original price is returned.

## Functionality
- The function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` is defined to calculate the final price based on the original price and discount percentage.
- If the discount percentage is 20% or more, the function applies the discount. If it is less than 20%, no discount is applied, and the original price is returned.
- The user is prompted to input the original price and the discount percentage, and the final price is printed based on the discount calculation.

## Instructions

1. **Inputs**:  
    - The program asks for the original price of an item (as a number).
    - The program asks for the discount percentage (as a number).

2. **Processing**:  
    - If the discount is 20% or higher, the discount is applied.
    - If the discount is less than 20%, the original price is returned.

3. **Output**:  
    - The program prints either the final discounted price or the original price if no discount was applied.
